# Technical Presentation Guidelines

Your technical presentation should include only a brief overview of the customer need, since the reviewing team(s) will have obtained this information before the presentation, either by watching recorded interviews or inspecting other project documentation.

The goal of the presentation is to give us (and your fellow students) insights about your process, not about your final product.

## Main points you should cover

* Indicate if this is a brand new ("greenfield") app or improvements to a legacy app
* Brief overview of the customerâ€™s need, and core features requested by them
* One or more specific technical challenges you faced, and how you addressed them. Did design patterns play a role? Did you have to extend/revise your design as you made progress on features? Did you find yourself having to refactor or otherwise improve legacy code in order to make progress on your features?
* What worked well and not-so-well in terms of your interaction with the customer (both in the iteration meetings and any other communications)
* What worked well and not-so-well (or what do you wish you had done differently/better) in terms of your team's technical approach to working together, following the Agile practices each iteration, and so on?  Possible topics (you don't have to address all of them) might include division of labor, strategies for coordinating teamwork, team communication, etc.
* Any pitfalls you would warn future developers about regarding this app?
* If you had 1 or 2 more iterations, what would you try to get done?

## Keep in mind while preparing your presentation

* Rehearse your presentation to make sure everyone is speaking clearly, making eye contact with the audience, and finishing the presentation on time. The target is 7 minutes.
* Don't put a lot of words on your slides. Since you will be explaining verbally, the slides should mostly feature visual aids (diagrams, charts, etc.) that accompany what you say.
* Don't write a script and then read it. Make a few notes to yourself on a 3-by-5 index card to remind you of the main points, but speak to your audience, don't read to them off a page. It is worth rehearsing multiple times until you are comfortable doing this!

## Deliverable

You will give this live presentation on 5/2 (Thursday).
